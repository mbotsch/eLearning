# Zoom Plugin

This is a slightly modified version the original [zoom plugin](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/tree/master/plugin/zoom-js). It properly handles reveal's slide scaling, zooms in/out on mouse double click (as opposed to Alt-click), and zooms in all the way to scale the clicked element to (almost) full-screen size.
